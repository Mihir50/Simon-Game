# Simon Game
Simon game created with html, css and js

There are four colored buttons, each producing a particular tone when it is clicked. A round in the game consists of the device lighting up one or more buttons in a random order, after which the player must reproduce that order by clicking the buttons. As the game progresses, the number of buttons to be clicked increases. If the persons fails to reproduce the correct order, the game restarts.
